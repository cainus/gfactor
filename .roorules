After every change, 

Put the current date time in the title of the extension panel to mark when it was compiled.

Make sure we're logging the current date/time as a static string (not dynamic) when the extension panel first shows up.

then verify the change with:

npm run lint && npm run check-types && npm run compile

Then create a package with:

npm deploy
